# âœ… Exercise 02 - Calculate the Tip

In this challenge, you will need to calculate the tip that restaurant customers should leave based on their consumption.

The `calculate_tip` function will receive two parameters, `bill_amount` which represents the total cost of what has been consumed, and `tip_percentage` which represents the percentage of the tip to leave. Both values will be of type float and will always be positive, including 0. The function should return the tip amount as a number.

> Remember that to round to two decimal places you will need to use round(number, number of decimal places)

You will have inputs and outputs like the following ðŸ‘‡

Example 1:

```python
Input: calculate_tip(100, 10);
Output: 10;
```

Example 2:

```python
Input: calculate_tip(1524.33, 25);
Output: 381.08;
```
